<p>Hi there! I’m Plyfaa :) </p>
<p>I’m a researcher and scientist curious about all topics relating to how we perceive and interact with the external visual world.</p>
<p>Currently, I am a postbaccalaureate research fellow at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), working in Dr. Peter Bandettini’s Section on Functional Neuroimaging Methods (SFIM). Under the mentorship of Drs. Peter Bandettini and Sharif Kronemer, I am investigating how pupillary dynamics (i.e., dilation, constriction, peaks, and troughs) are linked to neural activity and relate to shaping perceptual sensitivity and consciousness in real-time.</p>
<p>Feel free to explore my academic journey and projects on my website. Please don’t hesitate to reach out!</p>

title: "Visual Signals from Real-Life and Rendered Iridescent Objects"
excerpt: "<div style='font-family: \"Times New Roman\", Times, serif;'>Studying the perception of iridescence in Hannah Smithson's Lab, I explored how individuals describe and interact with dynamic, color-shifting materials through free-naming tasks and physical interaction using a High Dynamic Range (HDR) display and real stimuli.<br/><img src='/images/IMG_4527.jpg' style='width:1000px; height:auto;'></div>"

<p>Supported by the UK Rank Prize Undergraduate Vacation Grant, UC Davis Provost’s Undergraduate Fellowship, and Experiential Learning Opportunity Grant, I spent approximately three months conducting perception research in Hanah Smithson’s lab at the University of Oxford.</p>

<p>In our daily lives, we frequently engage in effective search within naturalistic scenes, implying that object and scene recognition often require minimal attentional resources. Disrupting scene regularities (e.g., placing a fire hydrant in a kitchen) is a common method to illustrate how scene context influences processes like object recognition, visual search, memorization, and action.<p>

<p>Drawing inspiration from the SCEGRAM image dataset (Öhlschläger & Võ, 2017), this project included the building of a dataset consisting of semantically congruent and incongruent objects with the scene context.<p>

<p>Previous research has extensively studied how behavior is shaped by the properties of our goals and targets. Examining the factors influencing attention and action in real-world contexts is crucial for understanding natural human behaviors in relation to the visual external world. Against this backdrop, the combination of an incongruent target paired with a congruent distractor has not thoroughly been studied, presenting an exciting opportunity to further investigate how the semantic roles of scenes and objects impact search, as demonstrated in Figure 1D.<p>
